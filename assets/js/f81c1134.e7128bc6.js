One-line summary\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Quick comparison\\n\\n| Aspect | Mastra | Microsoft Agent Framework + Azure AI Foundry |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Language / runtime | TypeScript / Node \u2014 ideal if your stack is JS | .NET and Python \u2014 first-class in Azure environments |\\n| Mental model | TypeScript-first framework for agents, pipelines, RAG, tracing, MCP | SDK + runtime for multi-agent graphs, successor of Semantic Kernel / AutoGen |\\n| Deployment | Self-host anywhere; Mastra Cloud for traces/evals | Standalone or connected to managed Foundry Agent Service in Azure |\\n| Model vendors | Multi-provider (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Llama...) | Multi-provider with first-class Azure model integrations |\\n| Workflows & orchestration | Pipeline / graph style in TS, suspend/resume, streaming | Graph-based orchestration, conditional routing, long-running, HITL |\\n| RAG / Connectors | Vector stores (Postgres, Pinecone), RAG templates | Native integration with Azure AI Search, Fabric, OneLake, SharePoint |\\n| MCP & tools | Strong MCP support, agent networks and tools | MCP as a tool type; Foundry provides catalog of managed resources |\\n| Observability | Mastra Cloud: traces, evals, scoring, UI | OpenTelemetry + Azure Monitor; platform dashboards & governance |\\n| Azure integration | Can run in Azure but agnostic by design | Deep, official Azure integration (Foundry, Fabric, Entra, Defender) |\\n| License / community | Open source (Apache 2.0); JS-focused community | Open source (MIT) + Microsoft ecosystem & docs |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Which to choose depending on context\\n\\n- If your stack is Node/TypeScript and you want fast iteration, Mastra is the natural fit: same language, quick developer velocity, good for MCP and scrapers.\\n- If you need full enterprise Azure governance (Foundry, Fabric, Defender, Entra), or your customer requires a managed Azure solution, Microsoft Agent Framework + Foundry is appropriate.\\n\\n**Hybrid approach (recommended for mixed environments):**\\n\\n1. Keep an agent core in JS (Mastra) for rapid iteration and product features.\\n2. For enterprise-grade RAG or Azure-centred customers, deploy Agent Framework / Foundry agents as managed services and expose them as APIs.\\n3. Use your Node/Mastra code to orchestrate and call those managed agents where strict governance is required.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. TL;DR / Practical suggestion\\n\\n- For quick PoCs, internal automations, scrapers and MCP-first flows: **Mastra**.\\n- For regulated corporate projects inside Azure, where governance and integrations matter: **MAF + Foundry**."},{"id":"over-engineering-vs-poc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-16-over-engineering-vs-poc.md","title":"Not Everything is a PoC, and You Don\'t Need Netflix for a CRUD","description":"In recent years, I\'ve seen two equally damaging extremes in many development teams: over-engineering and the eternal PoC culture.

This post is about why both extremes are bad engineering practices and how to find a reasonable middle ground.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What I Call \\"Over-Engineering\\"\\n\\nBy over-engineering, I mean solutions that:\\n\\n* Add **accidental complexity** without providing clear value.\\n* Break basic principles like **KISS** (\\"Keep It Simple, Stupid\\"), **YAGNI** (\\"You Aren\'t Gonna Need It\\"), and **DRY** (\\"Don\'t Repeat Yourself\\").\\n\\nSome typical smells:\\n\\n* Microservices for a product that doesn\'t even have a dedicated PM.\\n* Hexagonal architecture + DDD + CQRS + Event Sourcing\u2026 for an intranet with 50 users.\\n* Internal framework that only the person who created it understands.\\n\\nThe problem isn\'t using advanced patterns; the problem is doing it **without a business case** to support it. Complexity has to be \\"paid for\\" every day: onboarding, debugging, observability, deployments, refactors\u2026\\n\\n> If the cognitive cost of understanding the system is greater than the problem it solves, you\'re probably over-engineering.\\n\\n## What I Call \\"PoC Culture\\" (and Why It\'s Equally Toxic)\\n\\nOn the other extreme is the culture of:\\n\\n> \\"Do a quick PoC, we\'ll put it in production to test it, and we\'ll refactor it later\\".\\n\\nSpoiler: **\\"later\\" never comes**.\\n\\nA PoC (Proof of Concept) is designed to **validate an idea with minimal effort**, not to last for years: it usually doesn\'t have tests, security best practices, or decent observability. Taking that PoC as-is to production is a technical debt factory.\\n\\nAnd here\'s the trap:\\n\\n* The PoC **works**, the business gets used to it.\\n* More things get connected around it.\\n* It becomes \\"scary\\" to touch because \\"it breaks everything\\".\\n* Refactoring becomes increasingly expensive.\\n\\nAs Jason Lengstorf summarized: almost every company has code in production that was born as a PoC and was never rewritten.\\n\\n## Technical Debt: Tool, Not Excuse\\n\\nThis is where the concept of **technical debt** comes in: taking a shortcut now knowing that you\'ll pay an extra maintenance cost in the future.\\n\\nMartin Fowler proposes a very useful quadrant: **prudent vs reckless** and **deliberate vs inadvertent**.\\n\\n* **Deliberate + prudent**:\\n  You know you\'re introducing debt, you accept it consciously, and you have a plan to pay it off. Example: doing something more \\"hardcoded\\" to reach a launch, with a task created to refactor later.\\n\\n* **Deliberate + reckless**:\\n  \\"We don\'t have time for design, we\'ll see\\". No cleanup plan. This is gasoline for future fires.\\n\\n* **Inadvertent + prudent**:\\n  You did the best you knew how, but later you learn a better way. Normal.\\n\\n* **Inadvertent + reckless**:\\n  Sloppy code due to lack of knowledge and no intention to improve.\\n\\nThe moral: **good technical debt exists** (it\'s a strategic investment); the bad kind is what you introduce unknowingly or knowing you won\'t pay it off.\\n\\n## How Over-Engineering and PoC Culture Feed Each Other\\n\\nThe funny (or sad) thing is that these two pathologies **reinforce each other**:\\n\\n1. A team suffers from over-engineering:\\n   * Changing anything in the system is extremely expensive.\\n   * Everything takes weeks.\\n   * The business gets frustrated.\\n\\n2. The business responds with \\"PoC mode\\":\\n   * \\"Do something quick on the side, even if it\'s ugly, but make it work now\\".\\n   * A parallel PoC is born, without engineering discipline.\\n\\n3. That PoC ends up in production.\\n   * Now you have a monster: excessive architecture on one side, experimental spaghetti on the other.\\n\\nAnd around we go again.\\n\\n## Practical Framework for Devs/Architects: Quick PoC or \\"Real\\" Engineering?\\n\\nAs an architect or technical lead, your job isn\'t to apply textbook patterns, but to **make conscious cost/benefit decisions**.\\n\\n### 1. Quick Check to Avoid Over-Engineering\\n\\nBefore adding another layer, another microservice, or a new pattern, ask yourself:\\n\\n1. **What specific problem does this solve today?**\\n   If the answer is \\"in case tomorrow\u2026\\", it sounds like YAGNI.\\n\\n2. **Do I have real signals that the future is coming?**\\n   Metrics, roadmap, customers, not just \\"architectural intuition\\".\\n\\n3. **Can I start with something simpler and extract it later?**\\n   For example:\\n   * Start with a module in a monolith \u2192 extract to microservice when there\'s clear need.\\n   * Start with a single database \u2192 separate later by bounded contexts when it really hurts.\\n\\n4. **Is my team prepared for the complexity I\'m introducing?**\\n   An architecture is only as good as the people who have to maintain it.\\n\\nIf you can\'t justify the complexity in terms of **reduced risk or saved cost**, you\'re probably designing for your ego rather than the product.\\n\\n### 2. Quick Check to Avoid the Eternal PoC\\n\\nWhen someone says \\"it\'s just a test\\", think:\\n\\n1. **Could this code be in production in 6\u201312 months?**\\n   If the honest answer is \\"yes, likely\\", then it\'s not \\"just a PoC\\":\\n   * require minimum quality,\\n   * at least some basic tests,\\n   * decent logging and some observability.\\n\\n2. **What part of the system depends on this?**\\n   * Will it move money?\\n   * Does it affect critical data?\\n   * The main user experience?\\n\\n3. **Is the debt I\'m introducing recorded?**\\n   \\"We\'ll refactor it later\\" doesn\'t cut it:\\n   * write concrete tickets,\\n   * assign priorities,\\n   * comment the context in the code when taking shortcuts.\\n\\n4. **Is there an \\"expiration date\\" for this PoC?**\\n   For example:\\n   > \\"This PoC service will live for a maximum of 3 months. If after 3 months it\'s still providing value, we plan its rewrite/industrialization\\".\\n\\nWithout a timebox, the PoC mutates into legacy system.\\n\\n## Recommended Work Pattern: PoC \u2192 Prototype \u2192 Product\\n\\nA healthy way to work (especially in cloud/SaaS environments) is to think in three levels:\\n\\n1. **PoC**\\n   * Objective: validate an idea (technical or business).\\n   * Minimum criteria:\\n     * It can break; it\'s for controlled environment.\\n     * You document consciously: *\\"not intended for production\\"*.\\n\\n2. **\\"Production-like\\" Prototype**\\n   * Objective: approach what the real version would be.\\n   * Here you already apply:\\n     * architecture that makes sense,\\n     * clear boundaries,\\n     * basic security,\\n     * minimum observability.\\n\\n3. **Stable Product/Service**\\n   * Objective: operate in production for years.\\n   * Requires:\\n     * clear SLOs/SLAs,\\n     * serious pipelines,\\n     * reliability metrics,\\n     * evolution strategy.\\n\\nThe PoC \u2192 product jump **without an intermediate phase** is what so often ends in technical debt nightmare.\\n\\n## What You Can Do as a Dev/Architect (Even If You\'re Not \\"CTO\\")\\n\\nSome very concrete actions you can incorporate into your daily practice:\\n\\n* **Put language to shortcuts**\\n  When someone asks \\"do it quickly\\":\\n  * \\"Okay, but that implies technical debt of type X. We accept it if we then dedicate Y hours to cleaning it up\\".\\n\\n* **Visualize complexity**\\n  * Simple diagrams (C4 level 1\u20132) to show when the architecture is becoming absurd for the product size.\\n\\n* **Measure the pain**\\n  * \\"Every change in this module takes us two weeks and breaks three things\\".\\n  * That opens doors to propose refactors, simplification, or re-architecture.\\n\\n* **Negotiate conditions for a PoC**\\n  * Clear timebox.\\n  * What can be sacrificed (performance, internal cleanliness) and what CANNOT (basic security, privacy, data integrity).\\n\\n## Conclusion: Engineering \u2260 Dogma, It\'s Managing Trade-offs\\n\\nNot every project deserves a textbook architecture, nor is anything acceptable with \\"it\'s just a test\\". Both extremes are, fundamentally, **lack of engineering**:\\n\\n* Over-engineering ignores the real cost of complexity.\\n* Eternal PoC culture ignores the real cost of technical debt.\\n\\nReal software engineering is about this:\\n\\n> **Making explicit decisions about where you accept complexity and where you accept debt, with a plan to manage both over time.**\\n\\nIf you take one thing from this post, let it be this idea:\\n\\n* When you\'re going to design: ask yourself *\\"can I make it simpler without losing the essential?\\"*.\\n* When you\'re going to \\"do something quick\\": ask yourself *\\"am I willing to pay the price of leaving it like this?\\"*.\\n\\nYou won\'t find the balance in any book: you\'ll build it yourself, project by project, decision by decision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## References\\n\\n* [KISS vs. DRY vs. YAGNI: Understanding Key Software Development Principles](https://rrmartins.medium.com/kiss-vs-dry-vs-yagni-understanding-key-software-development-principles-e307b7419636)\\n* [Technical Debt Quadrant - Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html)\\n* [When Proof of Concepts Become Production Code](https://blog.scaledcode.com/blog/poc-to-production/)\\n* [YAGNI - Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html)"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-15-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to my blog!","description":"Hello and welcome to my personal blog! \ud83d\udc4b","date":"2025-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Personal","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal","description":"Personal posts"}],"readingTime":1.07,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\xe9s Carmona Gil","title":"Desarrollador & Creador de Contenido","url":"https://github.com/valdepeace","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/valdepeace"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/valdepeace","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/valdepeace/","github":"https://github.com/valdepeace"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/valdepeace.png","key":"valdepeace"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to my blog!","authors":["valdepeace"],"tags":["personal"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Not Everything is a PoC, and You Don\'t Need Netflix for a CRUD","permalink":"/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc"}},"content":"Hello and welcome to my personal blog! \ud83d\udc4b\\n\\nThis is the first post of many to come.
