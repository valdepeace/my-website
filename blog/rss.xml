<li class="">If your stack is Node/TypeScript and you want fast iteration, Mastra is the natural fit: same language, quick developer velocity, good for MCP and scrapers.</li>
<li class="">If you need full enterprise Azure governance (Foundry, Fabric, Defender, Entra), or your customer requires a managed Azure solution, Microsoft Agent Framework + Foundry is appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hybrid approach (recommended for mixed environments):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="">Keep an agent core in JS (Mastra) for rapid iteration and product features.</li>
<li class="">For enterprise-grade RAG or Azure-centred customers, deploy Agent Framework / Foundry agents as managed services and expose them as APIs.</li>
<li class="">Use your Node/Mastra code to orchestrate and call those managed agents where strict governance is required.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, I've seen two equally damaging extremes in many development teams: <strong>over-engineering</strong> and the <strong>eternal PoC culture</strong>. This post is about why both extremes are bad engineering practices and how to find a reasonable middle ground.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-i-call-over-engineering">What I Call "Over-Engineering"<a href="https://valdepeace.com/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc#what-i-call-over-engineering" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What I Call &quot;Over-Engineering&quot;" title="Direct link to What I Call &quot;Over-Engineering&quot;" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>By over-engineering, I mean solutions that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Add <strong>accidental complexity</strong> without providing clear value.</li>
<li class="">Break basic principles like <strong>KISS</strong> ("Keep It Simple, Stupid"), <strong>YAGNI</strong> ("You Aren't Gonna Need It"), and <strong>DRY</strong> ("Don't Repeat Yourself").</li>
</ul>
<p>Some typical smells:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Microservices for a product that doesn't even have a dedicated PM.</li>
<li class="">Hexagonal architecture + DDD + CQRS + Event Sourcing… for an intranet with 50 users.</li>
<li class="">Internal framework that only the person who created it understands.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem isn't using advanced patterns; the problem is doing it <strong>without a business case</strong> to support it. Complexity has to be "paid for" every day: onboarding, debugging, observability, deployments, refactors…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the cognitive cost of understanding the system is greater than the problem it solves, you're probably over-engineering.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-i-call-poc-culture-and-why-its-equally-toxic">What I Call "PoC Culture" (and Why It's Equally Toxic)<a href="https://valdepeace.com/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc#what-i-call-poc-culture-and-why-its-equally-toxic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What I Call &quot;PoC Culture&quot; (and Why It's Equally Toxic)" title="Direct link to What I Call &quot;PoC Culture&quot; (and Why It's Equally Toxic)" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>On the other extreme is the culture of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do a quick PoC, we'll put it in production to test it, and we'll refactor it later".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spoiler: <strong>"later" never comes</strong>.</p>
<p>A PoC (Proof of Concept) is designed to <strong>validate an idea with minimal effort</strong>, not to last for years: it usually doesn't have tests, security best practices, or decent observability. Taking that PoC as-is to production is a technical debt factory.</p>
<p>And here's the trap:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">The PoC <strong>works</strong>, the business gets used to it.</li>
<li class="">More things get connected around it.</li>
<li class="">It becomes "scary" to touch because "it breaks everything".</li>
<li class="">Refactoring becomes increasingly expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Jason Lengstorf summarized: almost every company has code in production that was born as a PoC and was never rewritten.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="technical-debt-tool-not-excuse">Technical Debt: Tool, Not Excuse<a href="https://valdepeace.com/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc#technical-debt-tool-not-excuse" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical Debt: Tool, Not Excuse" title="Direct link to Technical Debt: Tool, Not Excuse" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>This is where the concept of <strong>technical debt</strong> comes in: taking a shortcut now knowing that you'll pay an extra maintenance cost in the future.</p>
<p>Martin Fowler proposes a very useful quadrant: <strong>prudent vs reckless</strong> and <strong>deliberate vs inadvertent</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Deliberate + prudent</strong>:
You know you're introducing debt, you accept it consciously, and you have a plan to pay it off. Example: doing something more "hardcoded" to reach a launch, with a task created to refactor later.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Deliberate + reckless</strong>:
"We don't have time for design, we'll see". No cleanup plan. This is gasoline for future fires.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Inadvertent + prudent</strong>:
You did the best you knew how, but later you learn a better way. Normal.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Inadvertent + reckless</strong>:
Sloppy code due to lack of knowledge and no intention to improve.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The moral: <strong>good technical debt exists</strong> (it's a strategic investment); the bad kind is what you introduce unknowingly or knowing you won't pay it off.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="how-over-engineering-and-poc-culture-feed-each-other">How Over-Engineering and PoC Culture Feed Each Other<a href="https://valdepeace.com/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc#how-over-engineering-and-poc-culture-feed-each-other" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Over-Engineering and PoC Culture Feed Each Other" title="Direct link to How Over-Engineering and PoC Culture Feed Each Other" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The funny (or sad) thing is that these two pathologies <strong>reinforce each other</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p>A team suffers from over-engineering:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Changing anything in the system is extremely expensive.</li>
<li class="">Everything takes weeks.</li>
<li class="">The business gets frustrated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The business responds with "PoC mode":</p>
<ul>
<li class="">"Do something quick on the side, even if it's ugly, but make it work now".</li>
<li class="">A parallel PoC is born, without engineering discipline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>That PoC ends up in production.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Now you have a monster: excessive architecture on one side, experimental spaghetti on the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And around we go again.</p>

<p>As an architect or technical lead, your job isn't to apply textbook patterns, but to <strong>make conscious cost/benefit decisions</strong>.</p>

<p>Before adding another layer, another microservice, or a new pattern, ask yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><strong>What specific problem does this solve today?</strong>
If the answer is "in case tomorrow…", it sounds like YAGNI.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Do I have real signals that the future is coming?</strong>
Metrics, roadmap, customers, not just "architectural intuition".</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Can I start with something simpler and extract it later?</strong>
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Start with a module in a monolith → extract to microservice when there's clear need.</li>
<li class="">Start with a single database → separate later by bounded contexts when it really hurts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Is my team prepared for the complexity I'm introducing?</strong>
An architecture is only as good as the people who have to maintain it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can't justify the complexity in terms of <strong>reduced risk or saved cost</strong>, you're probably designing for your ego rather than the product.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="2-quick-check-to-avoid-the-eternal-poc">2. Quick Check to Avoid the Eternal PoC<a href="https://valdepeace.com/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc#2-quick-check-to-avoid-the-eternal-poc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Quick Check to Avoid the Eternal PoC" title="Direct link to 2. Quick Check to Avoid the Eternal PoC" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When someone says "it's just a test", think:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Could this code be in production in 6–12 months?</strong>
If the honest answer is "yes, likely", then it's not "just a PoC":</p>
<ul>
<li class="">require minimum quality,</li>
<li class="">at least some basic tests,</li>
<li class="">decent logging and some observability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>What part of the system depends on this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Will it move money?</li>
<li class="">Does it affect critical data?</li>
<li class="">The main user experience?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Is the debt I'm introducing recorded?</strong>
"We'll refactor it later" doesn't cut it:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">write concrete tickets,</li>
<li class="">assign priorities,</li>
<li class="">comment the context in the code when taking shortcuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Is there an "expiration date" for this PoC?</strong>
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This PoC service will live for a maximum of 3 months. If after 3 months it's still providing value, we plan its rewrite/industrialization".</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Without a timebox, the PoC mutates into legacy system.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="recommended-work-pattern-poc--prototype--product">Recommended Work Pattern: PoC → Prototype → Product<a href="https://valdepeace.com/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc#recommended-work-pattern-poc--prototype--product" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Recommended Work Pattern: PoC → Prototype → Product" title="Direct link to Recommended Work Pattern: PoC → Prototype → Product" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>A healthy way to work (especially in cloud/SaaS environments) is to think in three levels:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><strong>PoC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Objective: validate an idea (technical or business).</li>
<li class="">Minimum criteria:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li class="">It can break; it's for controlled environment.</li>
<li class="">You document consciously: <em>"not intended for production"</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>"Production-like" Prototype</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Objective: approach what the real version would be.</li>
<li class="">Here you already apply:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li class="">architecture that makes sense,</li>
<li class="">clear boundaries,</li>
<li class="">basic security,</li>
<li class="">minimum observability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Stable Product/Service</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Objective: operate in production for years.</li>
<li class="">Requires:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li class="">clear SLOs/SLAs,</li>
<li class="">serious pipelines,</li>
<li class="">reliability metrics,</li>
<li class="">evolution strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The PoC → product jump <strong>without an intermediate phase</strong> is what so often ends in technical debt nightmare.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-you-can-do-as-a-devarchitect-even-if-youre-not-cto">What You Can Do as a Dev/Architect (Even If You're Not "CTO")<a href="https://valdepeace.com/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc#what-you-can-do-as-a-devarchitect-even-if-youre-not-cto" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What You Can Do as a Dev/Architect (Even If You're Not &quot;CTO&quot;)" title="Direct link to What You Can Do as a Dev/Architect (Even If You're Not &quot;CTO&quot;)" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Some very concrete actions you can incorporate into your daily practice:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Put language to shortcuts</strong>
When someone asks "do it quickly":</p>
<ul>
<li class="">"Okay, but that implies technical debt of type X. We accept it if we then dedicate Y hours to cleaning it up".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Visualize complexity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Simple diagrams (C4 level 1–2) to show when the architecture is becoming absurd for the product size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Measure the pain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">"Every change in this module takes us two weeks and breaks three things".</li>
<li class="">That opens doors to propose refactors, simplification, or re-architecture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Negotiate conditions for a PoC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Clear timebox.</li>
<li class="">What can be sacrificed (performance, internal cleanliness) and what CANNOT (basic security, privacy, data integrity).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="conclusion-engineering--dogma-its-managing-trade-offs">Conclusion: Engineering ≠ Dogma, It's Managing Trade-offs<a href="https://valdepeace.com/blog/over-engineering-vs-poc#conclusion-engineering--dogma-its-managing-trade-offs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion: Engineering ≠ Dogma, It's Managing Trade-offs" title="Direct link to Conclusion: Engineering ≠ Dogma, It's Managing Trade-offs" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Not every project deserves a textbook architecture, nor is anything acceptable with "it's just a test". Both extremes are, fundamentally, <strong>lack of engineering</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Over-engineering ignores the real cost of complexity.</li>
<li class="">Eternal PoC culture ignores the real cost of technical debt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real software engineering is about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Making explicit decisions about where you accept complexity and where you accept debt, with a plan to manage both over time.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take one thing from this post, let it be this idea:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">When you're going to design: ask yourself <em>"can I make it simpler without losing the essential?"</em>.</li>
<li class="">When you're going to "do something quick": ask yourself <em>"am I willing to pay the price of leaving it like this?"</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You won't find the balance in any book: you'll build it yourself, project by project, decision by decision.</p>
