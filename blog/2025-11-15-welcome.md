Hello and welcome to my personal blog! 👋

This is the first post of many to come. Here I'll share my experiences, learnings, and reflections about technology, software development, and everything I'm passionate about.

<!--truncate-->

## What will you find here?

In this space I'll publish content about:

- **💻 Web Development:** Tutorials, tips, and best practices
- **🚀 Modern Technologies:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, and more
- **📚 Learnings:** Experiences and lessons learned
- **🔧 Tools:** Reviews and guides for useful tools
- **💡 Ideas:** Reflections about the tech industry

## My vision

I firmly believe in sharing knowledge. The developer community has been incredibly generous with me, and this is my way of giving back a little of what I've received.

Don't expect perfect posts, but honest, practical, and useful content based on real experiences.

## What's coming?

In the upcoming posts I'll talk about:

- How I set up this site with Docusaurus
- Best practices in React and TypeScript
- Tools I use daily
- Projects I'm working on
